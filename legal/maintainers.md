List of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes

Please follow the guidelines below.

All of these guidelines matter for every patch.

1. Always _test_ your changes, however small, on at least 4 or 5 people, preferably many more.

2. Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple configurations.

3. Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use 'diff -u' to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your changes sent back with requests about formatting.

PLEASE check your patch with the automated style checker (scripts/checkpatch.pl) to catch trival style violations. See Documentation/CodingStyle for guidance here.

PLEASE CC: the maintainers and mailing lists that are generated by scripts/get_maintainer.pl. The results returned by the script will be best if you have git installed and are making your changes in a branch derived from OpenPKW latest git tree. See Documentation/SubmittingPatches for details.

PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything or does something very odd once a month document it.

4. Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch not you.
